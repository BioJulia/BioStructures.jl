# BioStructures API

On Julia 1.9 and later the `DataFrame` and `MetaGraph` constructors are in package extensions in order to reduce the number of dependencies.
Call `using DataFrames` and `using Graphs, MetaGraphs` respectively to access these functions.

```@index
Order   = [:module, :type, :constant, :function, :macro]

```@autodocs
Modules = [BioStructures]
Private = false
Order   = [:module, :type, :constant, :function, :macro]
